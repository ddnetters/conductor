## üìú Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git
- Access to an n8n instance for testing

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/n8n-mcp-server.git
   cd n8n-mcp-server
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your n8n configuration
   ```

5. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## üíª Development Process

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Development branch (if needed for complex features)
- `feature/feature-name` - Feature branches
- `bugfix/bug-description` - Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/urgent-fix` - Urgent production fixes

### Workflow

1. Create a new branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following our [coding standards](#coding-standards)

3. Add tests for your changes

4. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run lint
   npm run type-check
   ```

5. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add workflow template support"
   ```

6. Push to your fork and create a pull request

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Tests pass locally (`npm test`)
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors (`npm run type-check`)
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed
- [ ] Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/)

### PR Requirements

1. **Fill out the PR template** completely
2. **Link related issues** using keywords (e.g., "Fixes #123")
3. **Provide clear description** of changes and motivation
4. **Include screenshots** for UI changes (if applicable)
5. **Update documentation** if the change affects usage

### Review Process

- All PRs require at least one approval from a maintainer
- Changes may be requested before merging
- CI checks must pass
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized

## üêõ Issue Guidelines

### Before Creating an Issue

- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
- Check the documentation and README
- Try to reproduce the issue with the latest version

### Bug Reports

Use the bug report template and include:

- **Environment details** (Node.js version, OS, n8n version)
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Expected vs actual behavior**
- **Error messages** or logs
- **Minimal reproducible example** if possible

### Feature Requests

Use the feature request template and include:

- **Problem description** - what you're trying to solve
- **Proposed solution** - your suggested approach
- **Alternatives considered** - other solutions you've thought about
- **Use case** - real-world scenario where this would be useful

## üé® Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code style (enforced by ESLint/Prettier)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Prefer async/await over Promises
- Use strict TypeScript configuration

### Code Organization

- Keep functions small and focused
- Use appropriate abstractions
- Follow single responsibility principle
- Maintain consistent file structure
- Export only what's necessary

```

Types:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)

- **End-to-end tests** - Test complete workflows

### Writing Tests

- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and error cases
- Aim for good test coverage

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests only
